silverstripe-userforms-payments
===============================

A small mod that adds the ability to accept payments from User Defined Forms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
Adds the ability to make a simple Donation page or similar in SilverStripe, using the super-intuitive UserForms interface and the crazy-flexible Silverstripe Omnipay module. 
 
## Getting started
Make sure you have a payment gateway set up (using the SilverStripe Payments via Omnipay module), then simply add a User Defined Payment Form Page to the CMS.

## Requirements
  * SilverStripe ^4.4
  * UserForms Module <https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms>
  * SilverStripe Payments via Omnipay <https://github.com/burnbright/silverstripe-omnipay>

## Limitations
  * Currently, the "Amount" variable is visible and therefore easy to manipulate on the front-end. This is intentional, as the form was designed as a quick "Donation Form", where the user could select their own donation amount easily.
  * Omnipay fields are not saved to the database, in order to save them, make some hiddenfields in userforms and do some js magic - this will be fixed in future
    
### Disclaimer:
This is a super crazy early alpha version of the module. It has been tested and is working on some of our sites, but I can't guarantee it will work for you. If you encounter any issues, just let me know and I'll get on to it as soon as I can. Any help getting this up to scratch would be greatly appreciated!
